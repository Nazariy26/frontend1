        <p>Tigers play a vital role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems. As apex predators, they regulate prey populations, helping to prevent overgrazing and maintain the health of plant life. Unfortunately, they are also among the most endangered species due to habitat loss and poaching.</p>
